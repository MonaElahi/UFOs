# Overview of Project

In this project a table has been created with to organize UFO sightings data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

# Purpose

users more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by adding more filters like city, state, country and shape.

# Summary

In this project several filteration options have been created however the filteration table is 
not user friendly. There are several drawbacks and many recommendations for the improvement in the table.

### Drawback

* The user would have to exactly know what they were looking for in order to display required results from the filter system.

## Recommendations

### Two possible additions to the site might be:

1. There should be a dropdown menu for each filter so its easy to do the 
   selection just by a click which would only display available data. 

2. One more column "count" should be added which displays total number of UFO sightings.
